        <p>
            I am a Front End Developer based in New York City. I got into coding because I want a career that is rewarding and something that I would love doing. I graduated with an AAS in Electromechanical Engineering Technology but it really wasn't something I wanted to specifically focused my career in, so I started to learn to code through freecodecamp.org and ever since I loved it and knew that being a Front End Developer was the right career choice for me. I spend most of my time learning and building skills through projects and collaborating with other developers. Checkout some of my <a href="#project">projects!</a>
